BUGS: 

-current random glitch that actually helps in favour: if spotted unit gets into a vehicle that vehicle becomes part of csar_contactarray, and stays as such when unit gets out (may cause groups to 'engage' empty vehicles - ie search party moving towards a landed chopper and sticking around) - seems to go away after a short time/unit moves a distance away though. maybe make it stay somehow ** if units engage the vehicle with a WP - they will stay moving towards unit until patrol timeout - this is good

TESTING:

-check to see how napalm works MP

-new BIS revive system
	test revive in mP more - need multiple players
	add dragging to bis revive from FAR actions

ADD/FINISH:

enemy HQ script - calls arty, calls reinforcements, calls paradrop, etc

-Custom fasttime script - 
needs to accel through to 'brightest' time of night - then to dusk/dawn, then not as quick through day

-add in opfor attack helo

-add mass ejection script to planes

-populate cities a bit


FUTURE: 

*possible FOB at SW airport for tank/heavy vehicle assaults?

*destroy radio tower for reduced enemy refo?
