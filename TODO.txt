current random glitch that actually helps in favour: if spotted unit gets into a vehicle that vehicle becomes part of csar_contactarray, and stays as such when unit gets out (may cause groups to 'engage' empty vehicles - ie search party moving towards a landed chopper and sticking around) - seems to go away after a short time/unit moves a distance away though. maybe make it stay?

check to see if napalm works MP/needs to be local or global
  create *master* patrol script which oversees all enemy unit groups and chooses to engate (as opposed to having each patrol script running on each group*
  -needs to engage with flares/artillery/smoke
  -needs to be appropriate response/call for backup
FORGET MASTER SCRIPT -  HAS TO RUN FOR EACH GROUP 
csar_engagedgroups 
All engaged group,targetpos 
Use sortby to get all nearest attacking within x meters 
That's total engaged amount 
Boom 

CUSTOM fasttime script - 
needs to accel through to 'brightest' time of night - then to dusk/dawn, then not as quick through day
  
test random patrols as they are - might be too many?
add group reduction script - infantry only, ignore convoys + increase distance?
**change revive system? (check overhauled arma3 revive system - new setunconcious/lifestate command)
	test revive in mP
	add dragging to bis revive from FAR actions

populate POW camp with enemies/patrols
populate big camps with more vehicles/patrols
fuck bitches get money
