BUGS: 

-current random glitch that actually helps in favour: if spotted unit gets into a vehicle that vehicle becomes part of csar_contactarray, and stays as such when unit gets out (may cause groups to 'engage' empty vehicles - ie search party moving towards a landed chopper and sticking around) - seems to go away after a short time/unit moves a distance away though. maybe make it stay somehow

TESTING:

-check to see if napalm works MP
-test random patrols as they are - might be too many? test to see how groupreduction functions more
-new BIS revive system
	test revive in mP more - need multiple players
	add dragging to bis revive from FAR actions

ADD/FINISH:

-Patrol script - working - running on each group individually - still need to complete waypointinjection
  -needs to engage with flares/artillery/smoke
  -needs to be appropriate response/call for backup

-Custom fasttime script - 
needs to accel through to 'brightest' time of night - then to dusk/dawn, then not as quick through day

-increase bleedout time

-populate POW camp with enemies/patrols

-populate big camps with more vehicles/patrols

-add in the 'find intel pos by searching a dead officer' functionality

-add in opfor attack helo

-add mass ejection script to planes

-populate cities a bit


FUTURE: 

*possible FOB at SW airport for tank/heavy vehicle assaults?

*destroy radio tower for reduced enemy refo?
